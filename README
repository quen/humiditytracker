This is an Android app created using Google's standard tools. If you want to
build it, go ahead and download the source.

Note that I threw this together in a hurry; it's a total mess and I don't
care. :) There's basically no documentation, the code is terrible, but it
does work.

If you just want to run it, please search 'humidity tracker' on Android market.
